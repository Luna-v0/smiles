This repo is an alternative to rdkit on validating smiles. There is two parts, the syntax validator that is in the src/smiles_checker/validator and the chemestry validator that is in the src/smiles_checker/chem. The syntax validator uses the SLY LaLR(1) parser.
This repo uses uv and has a .venv folder

You can find the parser information at the parser.out
