# Smiles Validator

A validator for SMILE chemical language using SLY LaLR(1) parser. The grammar was based on the LL(1) parser from this [article](https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/04/20/smiles-formal-grammar/), and from the [OpenSMILES](https://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html) Specification.

All the data related to the periodic table was retrived from the [Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON repo](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON/tree/master).
